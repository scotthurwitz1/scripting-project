# scripting-project
In this project, I will write a program containing two classes (i.e., Student and Roster). The program will maintain a current roster of students within a given course. Student data for the program include student ID, first name, last name, email address, age, an array of the number of days to complete each course, and degree program. The program will read a list of five students and use function calls to manipulate data. While parsing the list of data, the program will create student objects. The entire student list will be stored in one array of students called classRosterArray. Specific data-related output will be directed to the console.
